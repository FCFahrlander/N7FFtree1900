# N7FFtree1900


  I purchased a GE pre-lit Christmas tree in 2007. The lighting was composed of custom strings of
  clear Constant-on incandescent bulbs. Each string included 1, 2 or 3 groups of 49 constant-on bulbs
  and one fuse bulb in series. The strings making up the tree were configured as shown below:

    1  string  of 100 bulbs wired as 10 substrings of 10 bulbs each (used on the top of tree)
    1  string  of  50 bulbs wired as  1 substring  of 50 bulbs
    3  strings of 150 bulbs wired as  8 substrings composed of: 2 of 25, 4 of 17 and 2 of 16
    5  strings of 100 bulbs wired as  6 substrings composed of: 4 of 17 and 2 of 16
    1  string  of 100 bulbs wired as  4 substrings of 25 bulbs each

  There was a total of 1200 bulbs on the tree. When a Constant-on bulb burned out, it shorted itself
  out so that the other bulbs in the substring would stay lit. The remaining bulbs just burn a little
  brighter. This is certainly preferred to having a substring of 50 bulbs go black. However, as
  more bulbs burn out, the stress on the other bulbs increases which reduces their life. In a tree
  with 1200 bulbs you tend to miss burnt out bulbs. These factors plus the bulbs just getting older
  contributed to 'avalanche" type failures in recent years. I've actually watched a substring all of
  a sudden get brighter and brighter and in a few seconds all of the bulbs in the substring burn have
  burnt out including the fuse bulb. It happens too quick to stop. Yo just have to keep up with the
  maintenance on these type trees.

  Over the last 7 years, I have replaced about 500 bulbs. In the last 2 years it become common now to
  replace 50 to 150 bulbs each season. If the tree weren't so beautiful I would have given up on it.
  Now, however, the thought of an even more beautiful tree with less maintenance and an opportunity
  to employ an Arduino Micro to control the LEDs was all the motivation I needed for this project.
