============================================== History ================================================

  I purchased a GE pre-lit Christmas tree in 2007. The lighting was composed of custom strings of
  clear Constant-on incandescent bulbs. Each string included 1, 2 or 3 groups of 49 constant-on bulbs
  and one fuse bulb in series. The strings making up the tree were configured as shown below:

    1  string  of 100 bulbs wired as 10 substrings of 10 bulbs each (used on the top of tree)
    1  string  of  50 bulbs wired as  1 substring  of 50 bulbs
    3  strings of 150 bulbs wired as  8 substrings composed of: 2 of 25, 4 of 17 and 2 of 16
    5  strings of 100 bulbs wired as  6 substrings composed of: 4 of 17 and 2 of 16
    1  string  of 100 bulbs wired as  4 substrings of 25 bulbs each

  There was a total of 1200 bulbs on the tree. When a Constant-on bulb burned out, it shorted itself
  out so that the other bulbs in the substring would stay lit. The remaining bulbs just burn a little
  brighter. This is certainly preferred to having a substring of 50 bulbs go black. However, as
  more bulbs burn out, the stress on the other bulbs increases which reduces their life. In a tree
  with 1200 bulbs you tend to miss burnt out bulbs. These factors plus the bulbs just getting older
  contributed to 'avalanche" type failures in recent years. I've actually watched a substring all of
  a sudden get brighter and brighter and in a few seconds all of the bulbs in the substring burn have
  burnt out including the fuse bulb. It happens too quick to stop. Yo just have to keep up with the
  maintenance on these type trees.

  Over the last 7 years, I have replaced about 500 bulbs. In the last 2 years it become common now to
  replace 50 to 150 bulbs each season. If the tree weren't so beautiful I would have given up on it.
  Now, however, the thought of an even more beautiful tree with less maintenance and an opportunity
  to employ an Arduino Micro to control the LEDs was all the motivation I needed for this project.

============================================= New Design ===============================================

  The 1416 LEDs in the new tree design are driven using an Arduino Pro Mini and 9 Adafruit TLC5947
  LED driver modules connected in series. The TLCs are driven using the SPI interface. Each of the TLCs
  has 24 channels of programmable 12 bit PWM output to drive LEDs. The output current on each channel
  is limited to a maximum of 15 milliamperes. The number of LEDs the TLC channel can drive is
  a function of the supply voltage (which can be as large as 30 volts for the TLC) and the forward
  voltages of the LEDs used. The LEDs I used have the following forward voltages:

                               LED      Forward   Max size  Min voltage
                               Color    Voltage   String     Required
                              =======   ========  =======   ===========
                               Red        1.6       14         29
                               Green      2.1       13         27 
                               Blue       2.4        9         28  
      
  The tree has 11 nodes along the trunk of the tree. Node 0 is at the bottom and node 10 is the
  top section of the tree. Each node is where there are 6 to 8 limbs attached to the trunk.

  Each limb is lit using 3 TLC channels. One channel drives a string of red LEDs, one drives a
  string of green LEDs and the third drives a string of blue LEDs.
  
  The topper can be driven by 3 TLC channels. Currently, only one channel is used to drive 9
  white LEDs in series. Three are in the center and 6 surround the center..

  The organization of the sections and limbs and LEDs is shown in the following table: 

     Node         limbs   Cum     #    #      #      Cum             Cum    Cum      TLC

  The cabling to the TLCs provides the serial data, the clock and 2 other control signals as
  well as the 30 volts used to drive the modules and the LEDs. The data is clocked into all
  TLCs by bit shifting 24 sets of 12 bit PWM words data per TLC. The data for all the TLCs is
  held and minipulated in the bV table and then written to the TLCs using the
  tlcWrite function.

===================================== Problems Observed ================================================

   1. 2048 Problem
      ------------

   When the value 2048 (exactly 50% duty cycle) is used to light LEDs, sometimes LEDs do not light
   or light very dimly (perhaps brightness of 10-20). The situation is most easily demonstrated by
   lighting 2 neighboring TLCs with this brilliance. The higher numbered TLC (one further down the
   daisy chain) exhibits the dim/out conditions about 85% of the time. The following table shows
   the combinations of TLCs involved the failure has been observed:
   
   0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
   0---------------8 (see note)
     1-2
     1---3
       2-3
       2---4
         3-4
         3---5
           4-5
           4---6
             5-6
             5---7
               6-7
               6---8
                 7-8
             
   The failures often involve corrupted data passed to the higher numbered TLC. Using a trace feature,
   I have observed the dim values being shifted to subsequent TLC when new data is shifted in. 

   An odd circumstance is that failure combinations 0-1 and 0-2 have never been observed. Also, TLC 0
   has been observed to perform most matching the intent of the programmed patterns.
   
   I have tried a few things to get at the root cause of this problem. I tried changing the timing
   of the clock, latch and data signals. None of these changes made any difference. I also turned
   on the OE (blank) line during the tlcWrite operation. It made absolutely no difference. The
   corruption of the data may be occuring as it exits TLC2. Sometimes it is observed that all LEDs
   driven by a TLC go bright for a very short time and then go dim or off.
   
   The 0-8 combination observed is unique. I have not observed any other combinations involving TLC0.
   The data corruption seems to occur after TLC0 but it is odd that this corruption hasn't been
   observed ending up in a TLC closer to TLC0.

   The program avoids this problem by applying a "bandaid" in the tlcWrite function. This code
   shifts a value of 2047 to the TLCs every time it sees 2048 in the brightness table.
   
   2. The "flash" problem
      -------------------
   
   I have observed LEDs quickly lighting to full brilliance for brief
   instant and then go out. (a quick flash). I also have seen LEDs go to a bright level
   and stay on even when the brightness level was set lower. While tracing the 2048 problem, I have
   seem especially bright flashing.
   
   3. "RF" Problem
      ------------

   When placing the LEDs on the limbs while lit I observed that just handling the led strings
   would sometimes alter their brightness. It seemed as if there was an RF signal on the lines
   and my handling them was affecting the PWM duty cycles. No precise experiment was performed.

   The TLC5947 has a 4 MHz. internal oscillator which it uses for internal clocking. The data
   shifting into the TLC5947 shift registers can take place at speeds up to 30 MHz but the
   shifting from the Arduino is estimated to be at 0.75 KHz rate. It takes about 1.3 Msec to
   complete a tlcWrite (9 TLCs x 24 channels/TLC x 12 bits/channel). The Pro Mini 5v model has
   a 16 MHz internal clock. That is 62.5 ns per clock. Most machine language instructions use
   just one clock. The number of instructions
   
   Since the PWM signal is generated using a 12 bit counter, the PWM frequency is about 1 KHz.
   (4 MHz. / 4096).

     Kevin arrah's video on the TLC5940 uses the blank pin as a critical part of the interface.
     He showed it pulsing every 512 microseconds. It is a high rising pulse 200 nsec wide.  It
     is used to restart the PWM counter. He also uses this sequence: Blank high, then Latch
     high,then Latch low and then Blank low.
   

   4. Fluttering
      ----------

   Sometimes the LEDs from a TLC (usually the top one or one near the top) will start fluttering
   after they have been displaying the same pattern for a while. Just refreshing the display
   (tlcWrite) stops the fluttering. The flutter rate of is about 5-10 Hz.
